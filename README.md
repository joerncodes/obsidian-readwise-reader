**Important note**: This plugin is still very much **in beta**. There are still bugs I'm trying to work out, so before we go live in the Community Plugin repository, I'd be delighted if you could report any bugs you find. Thank you!

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin to send notes to the [readwise.io Reader](https://read.readwise.io) service. Please note that Reader is currently in beta, so in order to use this plugin, your Readwise account must have access to this beta.
